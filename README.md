TextGame
========

  After much experimentation and learning I have my first version of my text based game out for testing, as of yet I have
a simple world layed out that you can move around in, I'll be working on adding interactions in the coming weeks.
I'll be making a list of things to be done and knocking them out succesivley, I've programmed my game using the cmd
function in python 3, I'm still learning how to use the cmd function in python so it will be improved later on.

Things to do:
-------------
I'll now be listing future features in my FEATURES so check that out for upcoming features.
