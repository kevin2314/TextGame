TextGame
========

  After much experimentation and learning I have my first version of my text based game out for testing, as of yet I have
a simple world layed out that you can move around in, I'll be working on adding interactions in the coming weeks.
I'll be making a list of things to be done and knocking them out succesivley, I've programmed my game using the cmd
function in python 3, I'm still learning how to use the cmd function in python so it will be improved later on.

Things to do:
-------------
1.) Finished adding a mountain cliff region

2.) Adding a dungeon with initial descriptions and movement
	I will be continually adding this to the game, I have some ideas about
	creating a way to randomize the rooms to the dungeon so that jgetting to 
	the treasure will never be the same, also adding a way to exit dungeons
	quickly like a teleporting item or something similar willo be added in 
	the case that you are lost or dont feel like walking out.

3.) Implement an inventory to call on command, take things out and sell things from.

4.) Add a forging method to forge basic tools, i.e. an axe and a pickaxe(things like a sword and shovel will be added
at a later time when there is a fighting mechanic implemented.)

5.) Add the ability to cut down trees, this will add things like the ability to sell wood for an income, for processing
into charcoal, and other things added later down the road.

-------------

  This is all that I am adding for now, I should be able to finish the first two quickly enough to move onto the rest
of the items on the list in a timely manner. Untill then I'll be pushing updates as regular as possible.
